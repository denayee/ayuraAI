Safe Home Remedies for Skin and Hair Care\n\n*   **For Dark Circles (Skin):**\n    *   **Cold Green Tea Compresses:** Steep two green tea bags, let them cool in the fridge, and place them over your eyes for 10 minutes. The tannins and caffeine help reduce swelling and lighten the appearance of dark circles.\n*   **For Frizzy Wavy Hair (Hair):**\n    *   **Aloe Vera & Coconut Oil Smoothing Gel:** Mix 2 tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil. Apply to the ends of damp hair. Aloe acts as a natural humectant to lock in moisture and define waves.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Daily Care Routine for Skin and Hair\n\n**Morning Routine (Skin):**\n1.  **Cleanse:** Use a gentle cleanser to remove overnight sebum.\n2.  **Treat:** Apply Caffeine Solution to the under-eye area.\n3.  **Moisturize:** Apply a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer.\n4.  **Protect:** Apply SPF 46+ (Reapply every 2 hours while outdoors).\n\n**Evening Routine (Skin):**\n1.  **Double Cleanse:** Use a micellar water followed by your cleanser to ensure all sunscreen and outdoor pollutants are removed.\n2.  **Treat:** Apply eye cream.\n3.  **Hydrate:** Use a slightly richer moisturizer to combat moderate dryness while you sleep.\n\n**Weekly Routine (Hair):**\n1.  **Wash:** 2\u20133 times a week (avoid daily washing to prevent dryness).\n2.  **Condition:** Always use conditioner on the lengths and ends.\n3.  **Style:** Apply anti-frizz cream to soaking wet hair and \"scrunch\" to define waves.\n4.  **Scalp Massage:** Spend 5 minutes massaging your scalp with your fingertips (no oil needed) to stimulate blood flow and help with hair fall.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Ingredients to Avoid\n\n*   **Denatured Alcohol:** Found in many sunscreens and toners; it will exacerbate your \"moderate dryness.\"\n*   **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS):** Harsh detergents in shampoos that will strip your wavy hair of moisture, leading to more frizz.\n*   **Strong Synthetic Fragrances:** With a sensitivity level of 4, heavy perfumes can cause redness or irritation.\n*   **High-Concentration Retinoids (without supervision):** Can be too harsh for sensitive, dry-leaning skin types.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Lifestyle Tips for Better Skin and Hair Health\n\n*   **Sun Protection Beyond Creams:** Since you are outdoors, wear polarized sunglasses to prevent squinting (which worsens dark circles) and a wide-brimmed hat to protect your hair and scalp from UV damage.\n*   **Silk or Satin Pillowcase:** This reduces friction on your wavy hair while you sleep, significantly lowering frizz and hair breakage.\n*   **Hydration & Diet:** Increase water intake to help with skin dryness. For hair fall, ensure you are getting enough Iron and Protein (Biologically available sources like eggs, lentils, or spinach).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Explanation of Recommendations\n\n*   **Combination Skin & Dryness:** We chose products that hydrate without being greasy. The use of Hyaluronic acid helps your skin retain water without adding excess oil to your T-zone.\n*   **Dark Circles:** Your outdoor lifestyle suggests potential UV-induced pigmentation or fatigue. Caffeine-based topicals are the most effective non-prescription fix for this.\n*   **Wavy/Frizzy Hair:** Frizz is simply a hair strand looking for moisture. By using sulfate-free products and sealing the cuticle with a styling cream, we stop the \"frizz\" before it starts.\n*   **Medium Hair Fall:** This is often caused by environmental stress or physical breakage. The Briogeo mask and scalp massages focus on strengthening the root and the strand.\n\n---\n\n### 7.
