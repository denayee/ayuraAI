{"user_id": 6, "recommendation": "As a professional Dermatologist and Hair Stylist, I have analyzed your profile. Given your medium skin tone, outdoor lifestyle, and coily hair type, our focus will be on **UV protection, targeted treatment for hyperpigmentation (dark circles), and intensive moisture retention** for your hair and scalp.\n\nCrucially, because of your **Gluten Allergy**, I have filtered these recommendations to prioritize gluten-free formulations.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Recommended Cosmetic Products\n\n**For Skin:**\n*   **Sunscreen:** *EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46* (Gluten-free, great for medium skin tones as it leaves no white cast, and contains Niacinamide to manage medium oil levels).\n*   **Eye Treatment:** *The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG* (Targeted for dark circles and puffiness) or *Biossance Squalane + Marine Algae Eye Cream* (Gluten-free and deeply hydrating).\n*   **Cleanser:** *La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Cleanser* (Balances medium oil without stripping the skin).\n\n**For Hair:**\n*   **Shampoo:** *SheaMoisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo* (Sulfate-free and gluten-free; safe for dry scalps).\n*   **Deep Conditioner:** *Briogeo Don\u2019t Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Mask* (Specifically formulated to be gluten-free; excellent for split ends and medium hair fall).\n*   **Leave-In:** *Camille Rose Naturals Curl Love Moisture Milk* (Rice-milk based, gluten-free, providing the slip needed for coily hair).\n*   **Scalp Oil:** *Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil* (To address hair fall and dry scalp).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Safe Home Remedies\n\n**For Dark Circles:**\n*   **Cold Green Tea Bags:** Steep two bags, chill them, and place them over your eyes for 10 minutes. The caffeine and antioxidants help constrict blood vessels and brighten the under-eye area.\n*   **Cucumber & Aloe Vera Gel:** Mix fresh aloe with cucumber juice. Apply to the under-eye area to soothe sun-strained skin from your outdoor lifestyle.\n\n**For Coily Hair & Dry Scalp:**\n*   **Pre-Poo Oil Treatment:** Apply warm Jojoba oil or Olive oil to your scalp and hair 30 minutes before washing. This protects the hair shaft from moisture loss during cleansing.\n*   **Honey & Avocado Mask:** Mash half an avocado with a tablespoon of honey. Apply to the ends of your hair to temporarily seal split ends and provide intense moisture.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Daily Care Routine\n\n**Morning (Skin):**\n1.  **Cleanse:** Gentle foam cleanser.\n2.  **Eye Serum:** Apply caffeine-based serum to dark circles.\n3.  **Moisturize:** Lightweight, oil-free moisturizer.\n4.  **Protect:** **Mandatory** SPF 50+. Reapply every 2 hours since you are outdoors.\n\n**Evening (Skin):**\n1.  **Double Cleanse:** Use a micellar water followed by your cleanser to remove outdoor pollutants and sunscreen.\n2.  **Target:** Eye cream with Peptides or Vitamin C to repair dark circles overnight.\n3.  **Hydrate:** A slightly richer moisturizer to support the skin barrier.\n\n**Weekly (Hair):**\n1.  **Wash:** Once a week (or every 10 days) to prevent stripping natural oils.\n2.  **Deep Condition:** Use heat (a steamer or warm towel) to help the product penetrate coily hair cuticles.\n3.  **L.O.C. Method:** While hair is damp, apply **L**iquid (water/leave-in), **O**il (Argan or Jojoba), and **C**ream (thick styling butter) to seal in moisture.\n4.  **Scalp Massage:** 5 minutes daily with fingertips to stimulate blood flow and reduce hair fall.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Ingredients to Avoid\n\n*   **Gluten-Derived Ingredients:** Look out for *Triticum vulgare* (wheat), *Hordeum vulgare* (barley), and *Avena sativa* (oat\u2014unless certified gluten-free). These are common in hair proteins.\n*   **Sulfates (SLS/SLES):** These will further dry out your coily hair and dry scalp.\n*   **Drying Alcohols:** Ethanol, Isopropyl alcohol, and Alcohol Denat (often found in sunscreens; look for \"Alcohol-Free\" to protect your sensitivity level 3).\n*   **Harsh Physical Scrubs:** With a sensitivity of 3, avoid walnut shells or apricot pits which can cause micro-tears.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Lifestyle Tips\n\n1.  **UV Shielding:** Wear polarized sunglasses. Dark circles in medium skin tones are often exacerbated by \"periorbital hyperpigmentation\" caused by sun exposure.\n2.  **Mechanical Protection:** Wear a satin or silk bonnet at night. Coily hair is fragile; cotton pillowcases cause friction that leads to split ends and hair fall.\n3.  **Hydration & Iron:** Since you have medium hair fall and dark circles, ensure your diet is rich in Iron and Vitamin B12 (check for GF sources like spinach, lentils, and lean meats), as deficiencies often cause these two specific issues.\n4.  **Trim Schedule:** Visit a stylist every 8\u201312 weeks for a \"dusting\" (trimming only the split ends) to prevent the splits from traveling up the hair shaft.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Explanation of Recommendations\n\n*   **Dark Circles & Outdoor Lifestyle:** In medium skin tones (Fitzpatrick Scale IV), dark circles are often pigmentary. Consistent SPF and caffeine-based topicals are the most effective non-invasive treatments.\n*   **Coily Hair (Type 4) & Dryness:** Because of the tight curl pattern, your scalp's natural sebum cannot easily travel down the hair shaft, leading to split ends and moderate dryness. The \"L.O.C. Method\" is essential to mechanically lock in water.\n*   **Gluten Sensitivity:** While skin generally doesn't absorb gluten molecules, they can be ingested via hand-to-mouth contact (lip products) or through micro-tears in the skin. For those with allergies, \"certified gluten-free\" cosmetics prevent inflammatory responses.\n\n---\n\n### 7.
