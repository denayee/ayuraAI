{"user_id": 2, "recommendation": "Hello. Based on your profile, you are managing a complex combination of sensitive, acne-prone skin and a reactive, oily scalp. Given your specific allergies\u2014particularly to **Fragrance, Coconut, and Sulphates**\u2014your product selection must be extremely meticulous, as these are common base ingredients in most commercial cosmetics.\n\nHere is your personalized dermatological and hair care assessment.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Recommended Cosmetic Products\n*Focus: Hypoallergenic, Non-Comedogenic, and Coconut-Derivative Free.*\n\n*   **Facial Cleanser:** Use a soap-free, coconut-free cleanser like **Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser**. It is free of fragrance, sulfates, and common coconut-derived surfactants (like Cocamidopropyl Betaine).\n*   **Acne Treatment:** **Adapalene Gel (0.1%)**. It targets moderate acne and helps with skin cell turnover. Use this only at night. \n*   **Dark Circle Eye Cream:** Look for **Caffeine and Niacinamide** based serums. These constrict blood vessels and brighten the fair skin under the eyes without using heavy oils.\n*   **Sunscreen (Essential for Outdoor Lifestyle):** **EltaMD UV Pure Broad-Spectrum SPF 47**. This is a physical sunscreen (Zinc Oxide/Titanium Dioxide) which is safer for sensitivity 3 and is fragrance/oil-free.\n*   **Anti-Dandruff Shampoo:** **Vanicream (Free & Clear) Medicated Anti-Dandruff Shampoo**. It contains 2% Pyrithione Zinc but is free of sulfates, fragrance, and gluten.\n*   **Hair Fall Serum:** **The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density**. (Verify current batch is gluten/fragrance-free). It targets hair fall without being greasy on an oily scalp.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Safe Home Remedies\n*Focus: Soothing inflammation and balancing pH.*\n\n*   **For Dark Circles:** **Cold Green Tea Bags.** The caffeine and tannins help shrink swelling and lighten the fair skin tone area. Apply for 5\u201310 minutes in the morning.\n*   **For Scalp Itch:** **Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) Rinse.** Mix 1 part ACV with 4 parts water. Pour over the scalp after shampooing, let sit for 1 minute, and rinse thoroughly. This balances scalp pH and kills dandruff-causing fungus.\n*   **For Acne/Sensitivity:** **Oatmeal Mask.** Grind gluten-free oats and mix with water to create a paste. This is a natural anti-inflammatory for \"Sensitivity 3\" skin.\n*   **Avoid:** Do not use coconut oil or lemon juice, as these will trigger your allergies and increase sun sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Daily Care Routine\n\n**Morning (Skin):**\n1.  **Cleanse:** Gentle wash with lukewarm water and Vanicream cleanser.\n2.  **Treat:** Caffeine-based eye serum for dark circles.\n3.  **Hydrate:** A lightweight, oil-free, fragrance-free moisturizer.\n4.  **Protect:** Mineral SPF 50 (Crucial due to outdoor lifestyle).\n\n**Evening (Skin):**\n1.  **Double Cleanse:** Use a microfiber cloth with water, followed by your cleanser to remove outdoor pollutants and sunscreen.\n2.  **Treat:** Apply a pea-sized amount of Adapalene to acne-prone areas.\n3.  **Repair:** Apply a fragrance-free barrier cream (look for Ceramides).\n\n**Hair Care (3-4 times per week):**\n1.  **Wash:** Focus the medicated shampoo on the scalp only. Massage for 2 full minutes to allow the Zinc to work.\n2.  **Rinse:** Use cool water to soothe the itch and close the hair cuticle.\n3.  **Dry:** Air dry or use a \"cool\" setting. Heat can worsen an oily/itchy scalp.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Ingredients to Avoid\n*Given your specific allergy profile, read labels for these hidden names:*\n\n*   **Coconut Derivatives:** Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coconut Acid, Sodium Cocoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (very common in \"natural\" brands).\n*   **Sulphates:** Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate.\n*   **Fragrance:** \"Parfum,\" \"Fragrance,\" or essential oils like Limonene, Linalool, and Citronellol.\n*   **Gluten/Dairy:** Wheat Germ Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Casein, or Lactose (sometimes found in hair masks).\n*   **Latex:** Avoid using rubber scalp massagers; stick to silicone or your fingertips.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Lifestyle Tips\n\n1.  **Outdoor Protection:** Since you have fair skin and an outdoor lifestyle, wear a wide-brimmed hat and polarized sunglasses. This prevents the \"squinting\" that worsens dark circles and protects your scalp from UV-induced hair fall.\n2.  **The \"Sweat Factor\":** Since you have an oily scalp and moderate acne, sweat left on the skin will trigger breakouts. Always rinse your face and scalp with fresh water immediately after being outdoors/exercising.\n3.  **Dietary Awareness:** Since you have dairy and gluten allergies, ensure you are getting enough **Vitamin D and Iron** from other sources (leafy greens, lean proteins). Deficiencies in these are a primary cause of hair fall.\n4.  **Pillowcase Hygiene:** Switch to a silk or bamboo pillowcase and change it every 2 days. This reduces friction on your hair (less fall) and prevents oil/bacteria buildup from reaching your face.\n5.  **Water Temperature:** Never use hot water on your hair or face. It strips the natural oils, causing your \"Medium Oil\" skin to overcompensate and produce even more oil."}
